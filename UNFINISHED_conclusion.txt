We set out to determine if the final match results of two popular Multiplayer Online Battle Arena games, League of Legends and Defense of the Ancients 2, could be predicted based on data from both the start of a game and data from during the game. We used a few different model types in order to perform this prediction, and trained models on two different kinds of data. While our results showed some prediction capabilities, especially from data that was collected during each game, our models did not perform quite as well as we would have hoped.\\
In training and testing on both pre-game and mid-game data, we aimed to determine if there was a degree of universality between the aspects that the models used on each data type. As can be seen more specifically in the Comparison section, however, there is virtually no universality between the data and their models.\\
Finally, in using data from multiple games, we aimed to determine if there was any universality between these games that our models could find. [INSERT MORE TEXT HERE]
