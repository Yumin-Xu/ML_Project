Training this data set was also generally quite easy. The League of Legends data set that we used had included Riot Game ID values for each of the data points, which we removed as a part of preprocessing. Other than that, the same conversion of '0' and '1' values to 'FALSE' and 'TRUE' values (respectively) for the 'Win' category was performed, and the normalization to values between 0 and 1 for all non-win categories was also performed.\\
After this setup, the process was nearly identical to that performed while training the DotA2 set. For 100 iterations, the data set was split randomly into 80-20 proportions where the larger portion was used for training the Naive Bayes model.
